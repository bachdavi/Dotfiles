# Dotfiles

Development happens in `emacs`. `tmux` is used to manage sessions and
all terminal related things. `kitty` is the actual terminal. `zsh` is
the shell. `zprezto` is a selection of settings to use together with
`zsh`.

## Installation
Assuming that all binaries are installed, simply simlink the
configuration files into the `$HOME` directory.

The folder structure mirrors the one expected in the `$HOME`
directory.


### Emacs
To use all features, e.g. `emacs-jupyter`, install `emacs-plus`.

``` shell
brew install emacs-plus
```
